Hey There!!!

I'm C.Amrit Subramanian
the founder and author of this library

Let me just elucidate you.. about why I was too keen on constructing this.

Firstly..  I'm a student, currently pursuing higher education in Chennai, India... From Amrit Vidyalaya 

Yep.. now hopefully, it's the right time to smash the reasons, why I manufactured this package.

Getting your grooves under the category of python might be simple as proclaimed... But
When it's time to deal with ridiculous challenges like writing files[i.e csv, txt & bin] via python, that's gonna make you run frenzy.

With all due respect, in order to terminate excessive stress and chores from a programmer's life, I conceived this package to make ends meet right and work well mostly, under various aspects and phases.

If you are craving to find a package that could chop off unnecessary lines of code from your tremendous, massive project... Hey, congrats you're at the right destination to achieve your horizon. This is my motto & would certainly try my best to enhance and amplify this library...

Thanks For Supporting...


INSTRUCTIONS TO ABIDE:

    this package consists of 6 functions that you can import and implement

    ii]read_txt(filename, mode)
        ->this function helps you read the txt file via the read function.
        ->you should input p for printing the content or r for using the content for programming purposes in the function after filename.
    
    iii]write_csv(filename, total_columns, total_rows)
        ->this function help's you to create a csv file and append the elements you wanna, to the file you've provided.

       ->this function helps you read the csv file list by list.. via reader function from csv.
       ->you should input p for printing the content or r for using the content for programming purposes in the function after filename.

    v]write_bin(filename, *values)

    vi]read_bin(filename, mode)
       ->this function helps you to read a pickled binary file completely.
       ->you should input p for printing the content or r for using the content for programming purposes in the function after filename.
