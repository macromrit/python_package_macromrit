Description: Hey There!!!
        
        I'm C.Amrit Subramanian
        the founder and author of this library
        
        Let me just elucidate you.. about why I was too keen on constructing this.
        
        Firstly..  I'm a student, currently pursuing higher education in Chennai, India... From Amrit Vidyalaya 
        
        Yep.. now hopefully, it's the right time to smash the reasons, why I manufactured this package.
        
        Getting your grooves under the category of python might be simple as proclaimed... But
        When it's time to deal with ridiculous challenges like writing files[i.e csv, txt & bin] via python, that's gonna make you run frenzy.
        
        With all due respect, in order to terminate excessive stress and chores from a programmer's life, I conceived this package to make ends meet right and work well mostly, under various aspects and phases.
        
        If you are craving to find a package that could chop off unnecessary lines of code from your tremendous, massive project... Hey, congrats you're at the right destination to achieve your horizon. This is my motto & would certainly try my best to enhance and amplify this library...
        
        Thanks For Supporting...
        
        
        INSTRUCTIONS TO ABIDE:
        
            this package consists of 6 functions that you can import and implement
            
            i]write_txt(filename, fillers)
                ->this function help's you to create a txt file and append the elements you wanna, to the file you've provided.
                ->have to enter the file name first.
                ->then enter the string you wanna append in a single go.
            
            ii]read_txt(filename, mode)
                ->this function helps you read the txt file via the read function.
                ->you should input p for printing the content or r for using the content for programming purposes in the function after filename.
            
            iii]write_csv(filename, total_columns, total_rows)
                ->this function help's you to create a csv file and append the elements you wanna, to the file you've provided.
                ->have to enter the file name first.
                ->then enter the total number of columns you wanna have in your csv file.
                -> enter 0 if you are gonna append to a csv file that already exists else print the no. of columns you wanna have to create a new csv file and write the columns in it.
                ->then enter the total number of rows you wanna write to your csv file.
            
            iv]read_csv(filename, mode)
               ->this function helps you read the csv file list by list.. via reader function from csv.
               ->you should input p for printing the content or r for using the content for programming purposes in the function after filename.
        
            v]write_bin(filename, *values)
              ->this function helps you to create and append or direct append to a pickled binary file.
              ->should first provide the file name you wanna create or append elements to.
              ->then write elements one after another with commas separated.. elements might be of whatever datatype you wanna have.
        
            vi]read_bin(filename, mode)
               ->this function helps you to read a pickled binary file completely.
               ->you should input p for printing the content or r for using the content for programming purposes in the function after filename.
            
            after downloading the library you should import it using this command: 'import macromrit' or 'from macromrit import <the function you want>'
        
        WHY IS THIS LIBRARY USEFUL & HANDY??:
        
            _______________________________________________________________________
        
            normal lines of code to write a txt file:
        
                with open('filename.txt', 'a') as name:
                    print('hello world', file=name)
            
            when you use this library to write a text file:
                
                import macromrit
                macromrit.write_txt('filename.txt', 'hello world')
            _______________________________________________________________________
        
            normal lines of code to write a csv file with 2 columns and 3 rows:
        
                import csv
                
                vals = [
                ['name', 'phone'], 
                ['car', 'bike'], 
                ['cycle', 'scooter']
                ]
                
                with open('filename.csv', 'a', newline="") as writer:
                    main = csv.writer(writer, delimiter=',')
                    main.writerow(['column1', 'column2'])
                    main.writerows(vals)
        
            when you use this library to write a csv file with 2 columns and 3 rows:
                
                import macromrit
                macromrit.write_csv('filename.csv', 2, 3)
            _______________________________________________________________________
        
            normal lines of code to write a binary file with 5 elements:
        
                import pickle
                
                x="hello"
                y="hi"
                z="bye"
                a="clown"
                c="pen"
        
                with open('filename.bin', 'a') as writer:
                    pickle.dump(x, writer)
                    pickle.dump(y, writer)
                    pickle.dump(z, writer)
                    pickle.dump(a, writer)
                    pickle.dump(c, writer)
        
            when you use this library to write a binary files with 5 elements:
        
                import macromrit
                macromrit.write_csv('filename.bin', "hello", "hi", 'bye', 'clown', 'pen')
